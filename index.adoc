== Data Conversion

In SM2 calculations these 4 mechanisms are used to convert between Octet
Strings and Bit Strings.


=== Bit String to Octet String Conversion

If the bit string length is not a multiple of 8, add `0` to its left to ensure
the length is divisible by 8. Then create an octet string as below.

INPUT: Bit String stem:[B] of length stem:[b l e n]

OUTPUT: Octet String stem:[M] of length stem:[m l e n], stem:[m l e n] is the whole
number portion of stem:[(b l e n + 7)/8].

STEPS: Converting bit string stem:[B = B_0 B_1 ... B_{b l e n - 1}] to octet
string stem:[M = M_0 M_1 ... M_{m l e n - 1}], stem:[0 <= i <= m l e n - 1].

[stem]
++++
M_i = B_{b l e n-8-8(m l e n-1-i)} B_{b l e n-7-8(m l e n-1-i)} ... B_{b l e n-1-8(m l e n-1-i)}
++++

[stem]
++++
M_0 = text(the leftmost ) 8 - b l e n % 8 text( position set to ) 0 text(, the right of it is ) B_0 B_1 … B_(8 - 8(m l e n) + b l e n - 1)
++++

OUTPUT stem:[M].


=== Octet String to Bit String Conversion

Octet String to Bit String Conversion as follows:

INPUT: Octet String stem:[M] of length stem:[m l e n]

OUTPUT: Octet String stem:[B] of length stem:[b l e n = (8 times m l e n)]

STEPS: Converting octet string stem:[M = M_0 M_1 … M_(m l e n-1)] to bit string stem:[B = B_0 B_1 … B_(b l e n-1)], stem:[0 <= i <= m l e n-1].

[stem]
++++
B_(8i) B_(8i+1) … B_(8i+7) = M_i
++++

OUTPUT stem:[B].

=== Integer to Octet String Conversion

Converting an integer into an octet string, the basic method is to first
represent the integer in binary, and the output the bit string as an octet
string. This is the conversion flow.

INPUT: A non-negative stem:[x]; expected octet string length stem:[m l e n].
Where stem:[2^(8 (m l e n)) > x]

OUTPUT: Octet string stem:[M] of length stem:[m l e n]

STEPS: Convert a number stem:[x] based on stem:[2^8 = 256],
stem:[x =
x_{m l e n-1}2^(8(m l e n-1)) +
x_{m l e n-2}2^(8(m l e n-2)) +
... x_{1}2^8 + x_0] into stem:[M = M_{0}M_{1} … M_{m l e n-1}]

Given stem:[0 <= i <= m l e n–1], set:

[stem]
++++
M_{i} = x_{m l e n-1-i}
++++

OUTPUT: stem:[M]


=== Octet String to Whole Number Conversion

It is simple to convert an Octet String into a Base 256 whole number. Conversion
method below.

INPUT: Octet String stem:[M]

OUTPUT: Whole number stem:[x]

STEPS: Convert stem:[M = M_0 M_1 … M_{m l e n-1}] into whole number stem:[x].

stem:[M_i] is like a whole number within stem:[[0~255]]

[stem]
++++
x = sum_{i=0}^{m l e n-1} 2^{8(m l e n-1-i)} M_i
++++

Output stem:[x].

* `Q`: `SM2PublicKey`. User Public Key.

OUTPUT:

* `Z`: Byte String. Output of Pre-processing 1.

Formula is:

* `ID` is the User Identifier;
* `a`, `b` is the System Curve Parameter;

Pre-processing 2 is the process of using value `Z` and the message to be signed,
utilize SM3 to calculate hash value `H`. Hash value `H` is used for
the calculation of SM2 digital signatures.

== Calculation Process

=== Generation of Secret Key

SM2 secret key generation is the process of using SM2 calculations to create a
pair of keys, this pair of keys include a private key and the corresponding
public key. The private key is of 256-bits long and the public key 512-bits
long.

* None

OUTPUT:

* `k`: `SM2PrivateKey`. SM2 Private Key.
* `Q`: `SM2PublicKey`. SM2 Public Key.

For detailed calculations see GM/T 0003.


=== Encryption

SM2 Encryption is to use the public key of the given key pair to perform
encryption, in order to generate ciphertext. This ciphertext can only be
decrypted by the corresponding private key.

INPUT:

* `Q`: `SM2PublicKey`. SM2 Public Key.
* `m`: Byte String. Plaintext To Be Encrypted.

OUTPUT:

* Output `c`'s `XCoordinate`, `YCoordinate` are randomly generated x- and y-coordinates;
* Output `c`'s `HASH` was calculated as `HASH = SM3( x | m | y )`, where `x`, `y` are
  `Q`'s x- and y-coordinates;

Output `c`'s CipherText is the ciphertext, its length is identical to that of
the plaintext.

For detailed calculations see GM/T 0003 and GM/T 0004.
